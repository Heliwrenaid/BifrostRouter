TODO:
add more convenient tests
improve build.php ?
add custom Exceptions
SPEED_MODE: change route config file scheme (problem with static pages)

DONE:

---------------------------------------- 28.12.2021 ----------------------------------------

reorganize directories and files 
configure routes using diffrent methods (yaml, json, php)
cache RouterConfiguration object instead of BifrostRouter
choose router's modes while creating BifrostRouter instance 
added build.php to generate config file for SPEED_MODE and cache file for CACHE_MODE
SPEED_MODE check if config file exists -> solved by throwing exception
improved gen.sh

---------------------------------------- 29.12.2021 ----------------------------------------

new structure for defining routes (define options, route's name depends on controllerID)
    -> controllerID consists of path (without main controller path) and controller filename (without .php extension) 
        + can't have _ in filename
Route.php: check if controller exists
error if not unique routes names -> only DEVELOPMENT_MODE
error if not unique urls -> only DEVELOPMENT_MODE 
RouterConfiguration: page404 -> defaultController is controllers/Page404.php (can set another)
improved SPEED_MODE by developing special structure for JSON config file 
    + SpeedRoute class + RouterConfiguration.readConfigForSpeedMode()
DEVELOPMENT_MODE is slower but checks routes configuration on the fly + give information about errors
    -> check if routes names/controllers are unique
    -> check if urls is unique within all routes
    -> check if proper controller file exists
    -> throw exception if parsed route file give empty data (syntax error)
    -> throw exception if controller name is improper (contains '_')
updated gen.sh

---------------------------------------- 30.12.2021 ----------------------------------------
autoloading class -> using composer PSR-4

---------------------------------------- 06.01.2022 ----------------------------------------
BifrostRouter->handle():
    - controller can return one of 3 variable types:
        - int (code): 
            - will add to HTTP's response returned status code
            - throw error if HTTP status code is invalid
        - string ($scriptFilename):
            - will execute a script which:
                - must be placed in SCRIPTS_DIR
                - script's filename must be same as returned string
                - script is PHP file with .php extension
        - ControllerData($scriptFilename, $data):
            - script requirements as above
            - will execute script with ControllerData object (saved in $controllerData variable)
        - other types:
            - throw error
added ScriptSandbox class
BaseController is now a class, not interface
added config file in project root directory
    - rewrited classes in order to use constants
    - constants are loaded by function loadConfig()
        - function loadConfig() is defined in src/core/functions.php (autoloaded by composer)
Route->getName():
    - route name consist of route controller's path without CONTROLLERS_DIR and
        all '/', '\' characters are replaced by '-'
    - RouterConfiguration class throw error if defined route controller contains '-' character
change Route properities from 'private' to 'protected' (to fix SPEED_MODE)

---------------------------------------- 18.01.2022 ----------------------------------------
DEVELOPMENT_MODE:
    - check if directory with routes exists
make source compatible with PHP 7 (replace str_contains function)
more universal config.php (to fix bug on Windows)
run route controller inside ScriptSandbox
rename ScriptSandbox -> Sandbox


---------------------------------------- 21.01.2022 ----------------------------------------
path cannot contains: , and ~ (~ can be escaped)

---------------------------------------- 27-31.01.2022 ----------------------------------------
new route file scheme
	- added route groups
	- route name = group name + '-' + route name
	- throw error if route/group name consists '-' character
	- group name is a part of namespace for controller and directory name inside /controllers
	- convention: group name's first letter should be in uppercase (because it is namespace)
    - route template name is related to route name
    - new key for route: 'methods: GET, post' -> define route method (case insensitive), character ',' is delimiter
    - new keys for route: 'render: true' and 'context: <ARRAY>' -> render template with/without context
        - it is no need to create controller
controllers now must have proper namespace related to route's group prefix
updated gen.sh
updated build.php
Response class as static: new method to render template from route name
Response class: make rederiction (+ exit) from route name // require to run `php build.php` after changing routes

some changes in order to deploy a composer package
