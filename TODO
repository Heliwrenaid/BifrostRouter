TODO:
error if not unique routes names
add router's config file (filePaths etc.)
add more convenient tests
improve build.php ?
RouterConfiguration: manage options and page404

DONE:
reorganize directories and files 
configure routes using diffrent methods (yaml, json, php)
cache RouterConfiguration object instead of BifrostRouter
choose router's modes while creating BifrostRouter instance 
added build.php to generate config file for SPEED_MODE and cache file for CACHE_MODE
SPEED_MODE check if config file exists -> solved by throwing exception
improved gen.sh
